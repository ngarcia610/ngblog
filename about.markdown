![Reading, PA](/pic/Reading.JPEG)

I started in IT around 2012 in Reading, Pennsylvania. I've worked for companies of various sizes and enjoy learning about all sectors of IT. In my free time, I read nonfiction, study films, and expand my skill-set. Most of my experience is in on the infrastructure and ops side of things. I'm a self taught Pythonista and enjoy teaching myself various subjects. For consulting or inquiries, please e-mail admin@nathangarcia.net.
