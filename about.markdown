I started in IT around 2012 in Reading, Pennsylvania. I've worked for various companies and enjoy learning about all sectors of IT. In my free time, I read nonfiction, study films, and study IT. Most of my experience is on the infrastructure side of things. For consulting or inquiries, please e-mail admin@nathangarcia.net.
