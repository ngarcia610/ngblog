# Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey? by Oncken Jr and Wass
When you let a subordinate leave you with a task, you are distracting yourself from your responsibilities and are now working for the subordinate.
There are several ways to manage this:
- Make appointments to deal with issues and avoid spontaneous conversations.  
- Specify the level of initiative. Employees use five levels of initiate when dealing with issues (from lowest to highest):
1. They wait until they are told what to do.
2. They ask what to do.
3. They recommend an action, then wait for your approval to do it.
4. They take independent action but advise you immediately.
5. They take independent action and update you through routine procedure.
- Designate times for status updates.
- Examine your own motives. Develop a sense of security within yourself so that you can be comfortable in giving direct control to subordinates in order to further their growth.
- Develop your employees' skills.
- Develop trust by assuring them it's OK to make mistakes.


# How Resilience Works by Coutu
Resilient people have three defining characteristics:
1. They accept the harsh realities facing them.
2. They find meaning in terrible times.
3. They improvise and make do with what is at hand.
Works referenced include "The Stockdale Paradox" by Jim Stockdale and "Man's Search for Meaning" by Victor Frankl


# Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time by Schwartz and McCarthy
You can build physical, emotional, and mental resilience by replenishing your energy through rituals.

**Physical Energy**
- 8hrs of sleep and reduce alcohol
- At a minimum: Cardio 3x per week and strength training 1x
- Small meals
- Take breaks every 90 to 120 min.

**Emotional Energy**
- Deep breathing to diffuse negative emotions (irritability, impatience, anxiety, insecurity)
- Express appreciation
- View situations at alternate angles:
  - What would the other person say? (reverse lense)
  - How will I view this in six months? (long lense)
  - How can I grow and learn from this? (wide lense)

**Mental Energy**
- Reduce interruptions
- Respond to messages at designated times
- Identify your most important challenge for the next day, and attack it first in the morning.

**Spiritual Energy**
- Engage in activities that give a feeling of flow*.
- Allocate time to what you feel is important.
- Live your core values.

[\*The word flow here is referring to a state of focus explained in the book "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ]

# Overloaded Circuits by Hallowell
People who find themselves easily distracted, agitated, and impatient may be experiencing a new neurological phenomenon similar to ADD, called "attention deficit trait". This isn't a diagnosed condition, but more so a reaction to increasing demands on our time and attention. It can lead to an impaired ability to prioritize, manage time, and make decisions.

There are at least three ways to manage this:
1. Promote positive emotions: Connect with someone you like every 4-6 hrs.
2. Take physical care of your brain: sleep, exercise, diet
3. Organize for ADT
  - Attack a critical task first thing in the morning
  - Make an immediate decision on documents (act or toss)
  - Before you finish for the day write 3-5 important tasks for tomorrow

# Be a Better Leader, Have a Richer Life by Friedman
Total Leadership means planning activities that simultaneously boost all 4 domains of life (work, self, home, community).  
1. First articulate who and what matters most in your life.  
2. Reflect on each of the domains. What is important to you?  
3. After reflecting, create activities (experiments) that you will do to start seeing benefits.  
4. Narrow your list of activities to the 3 most important ones.  
5. Do those things and measure your progress (document your results).  

# Reclaim your job by Ghoshal and Bruch
Don't let blockers at work define your career.
You can reclaim your job and support company priorities using 3 strategies:
1. Prioritize demands - slow down and focus your time and attention
2. Liberate resources - attack your goals strategically and be patient
3. Exploit alternatives - anticipate and circumvent possible obstacles

# Moments of Greatness: Entering the Fundamental State of Leadership by Quinn
The fundamental state of leadership occurs when we have to lead during a crisis and forces us to rely on values and instinct instead of learned behaviors. This state is not sustainable since fatigue and resistance make us fall back to seek comfort. Interestingly, we don't need a crisis to enter this state and can do so manually by asking four questions:
1. Am I results centered? Articulate the results you want to create. Leave comfortable options behind and explore new possibilities.
2. Am I internally directed? Clarify your core values, act with confidence and authenticity, willingly initiate productive conflict.
3. Am I other focused? Commit to putting others before yourself.
4. Am I externally open? Learn from your environment, leave routine, and acknowledge the need for major change.

# What to Ask the Person in the Mirror by Kaplan
It's difficult to get feedback from others when you are in a position of power. You must get the answers yourself by asking questions.
There are seven challenges in leadership. Your questions should be focused around them:
1. Vision and priorities - How often do I communicate the vision and associated key priorities?
2. Managing time - Does the way I spend my time match my priorities?
3. Feedback - Do I give people timely and direct feedback they can act on?
4. Succession Planning - Have I identified potential successors?
5. Evaluation and alignment - Am I aware of business changes and am I evolving to meet those changes?
6. Leading under pressure - How do I behave under pressure?
7. Staying true to yourself - Does my leadership style reflect who I am?

# Primal Leadership: The Hidden Driver of Great Performance by Goleman, Boyatzis, and McKee
Your mood is contagious. In a management position your mood can impact your team's performance.
Be aware that being an effective leader requires more than faking positivity.
This process can help you gain greater emotional intelligence for leadership:
1. Imagine a highly effective leader.
2. Know who you are by identifying your strengths and weaknesses.
3. Plan for how to close the gap between who you are (step 2), and who you want to be (step 1).
4. Make the changes stick by repeatedly rehearsing that plan physically and mentally until it is automatic.
5. Identify others that can help you navigate this process.
