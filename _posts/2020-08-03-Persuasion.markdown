# Summary  
Cialdini uses research to explain that six principles determine how people are influenced by each other.  

# 1. Liking  
Characteristics that build liking are physical attractiveness, similarity, and alliance.  
**Attractiveness** - people will assume other good qualities in attractive people.  
**Similarity** - Verbal (building rapport) or nonverbal (dressing similarly, mirrored body language) can build similarity.  
**Alliance** - working together to accomplish a similar goal as well as demonstrating that you like the person.  

# 2. Reciprocation  
People will return a favor, even if the return is disproportionate to the favor and even if the favor wasn't requested.  
Bargaining can cause reciprocation when a person rejects a large request. If they then receive a smaller request as a follow up, they will feel inclined to either accept or produce a lesser offer.  

# 3. Consistency  
People have a tendency to want to appear consistent with their actions, beliefs, and statements. Agreeing to something before an event will make them less likely to decline an event when the time comes.

# 4. Scarcity  
Items in short supply appear more valuable.  
The theory of "Psychological Reactance" by Jack Brehm states that when freedoms are restricted people will try to regain or retain what is being suppressed.  

# 5. Social Validation  
People look for cues on how to behave when they are uncertain.  Partially filling a tip jar, or having a pager go off to seat people at a restaurant (advertising the restaurant's popularity as they walk around the mall) are examples.  

# 6. Authority  
People will defer to authorities in ambiguous situations. We are more convinced if they seem impartial. Authority figures can demonstrate being impartial if they come off as being honest.
