# Disclaimer:
Below are notes from the book "Amusing Ourselves to Death" by Neil Postman. They do not necessarily reflect my beliefs and are simply points that the author makes.

# Summary:
Neil Postman's book Amusing Ourselves to Death provides a brief history of how American society has shifted from a print culture to a television culture. He argues that the point of television is to provide entertainment, but in doing so makes all information entertainment (politics, news, religion, education). He explains that print culture produced highly literate societies that valued complex ideas, since print is a more rational form of communication. He closes with admitting that we should be aware that television is entertainment and continue to promote other forms of communication (such as print) rather than compete against the inevitable advances of technology.

# 1
New technologies have complex ways of influencing society sometimes outside of awareness. For example, eyeglasses are the "metaphor" that we can improve our genetics. Then we learn that microscopes reveal a world outside of our natural sight. Then we learn about our subconscious through microscopy. Even though these devices didn't directly lead to each other, the idea that grew from them allowed the others to be created.

# 2
America has transitioned from a print culture to a television culture. Written culture has more truth than spoken culture.  You don't have to remember specific details; you can reference them. The form of speech is more subjective. Relying on images and speech results in intellectual decline because you process them passively. Since a paragraph can be paraphrased, by design it must be processed. An image does not have to be processed in order to be consumed. [I question this because art forces you to reflect and can be an image.]

# 3
When the form switch from print to media, our heroes changed. His example is how we went from Charles Dickens to Michael Jackson. Our ability to naturally understand longer and more complex sentences has also shifted since people stopped speaking like written text.

# 4
Our values have changed. We praise a politician that speaks plainly and simply when in the past politicians spoke in long and complex sentences (such as Lincoln's debate with Douglas where each spoke for over an hour). Since print can be paraphrased, it inherently causes the reader to have to process it. Terms like "reading comprehension" are new since reading had to be comprehended in the past. Now reading can be absent-minded due to shorter attention spans and comprehension is viewed as added value.

# 5
With the invention of the telegraph, we became exposed to information "geographically irrelevant" to us. What makes information relevant is "its power to enable direct action." Since much of this new information didn't enable direct action, it produced situations where someone can know of a variety of things, but not know about them. Photographs began to compete with text since images are easier and faster to digest and require less mental effort. The author complains that images are limited in that they are disconnected from abstract concepts and you are limited to what is captured within the frame of the image. By learning the history of communication methods, we can put into perspective how current communication methods fit in the broader picture.

# 6
Television doesn't supplement writing, it attacks it. With television, everything becomes entertainment. Rational and entertaining are fundamentally opposed. The shift from "good information is rational" is now "good information is entertaining". Meaningful conversations don't occur since they are limited by time and interrupted by advertisements. Applause becomes the response, instead of reflection.

# 7
The phrase "Now...this" that is used in television implies that the content that was broadcast has no consequence, and the content to come has no context. Disinformation is a product of entertainment culture. It doesn't contribute to our knowledge and intelligence despite creating the belief that it does.

# 8
Religion fundamentally changes when televised. Eventually television will become the content of religion.

# 9
One of the dangers of entertainment culture is our ability to recognize that it is bad but also enjoyable. It prevents us from being informed voters because we are distracted by "images, appearances, and slogans". No one is more capable of restricting our speech and expression than ourselves.

# 10
Since television is not interactive, it cannot properly educate. Knowledge of academic skills cannot be utilized without conversations and questions. Using television for education teaches us to seek out entertainment. Entertainment culture is self perpetuating.

# 11
It is unrealistic to try and stop the advances of technology. Media becomes less dangerous when it is understood. Understanding television allows us to promote other forms of media, such as print.
